A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.","title":"Cover"},{"location":"sample%20encounter/","text":"TODO/stats {: .hash} Encounter Title: Burning Sands, Shattered Glass Location: The edge of the Mournland, near [[the town of sanctuary]] Ancient ruins with a magically sealed metal door. Environment: Ruins: The area is strewn with crumbling stone walls, providing some [[cover]]. Mournland Terrain: The ground is uneven and possibly difficult terrain: due to ash, debris, or warped earth. The Door: A large, heavy metal door, partially buried in the sand, is the focal point. It's clearly magical, radiating a faint aura (detectable with detect magic ). Visibility: The Mournland is often described as having a hazy, desert-like quality. Consider reducing visibility slightly, imposing disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond a certain distance or providing light obscurement. Enemy: Sand Fire Worms (Reskinned [[Swarm of Insects]] - Swarm of Poisonous Snakes stat block from the Monster Manual) Number: 1d4 + 1 swarms. Appearance: Glowing, dismembered arms made of burning sand that writhe and slither through the air. Stats: Use the Swarm of Poisonous Snakes stat block (MM p.338), with the following modifications: Type: Change to Monstrosity. Damage Type: Change all damage to fire damage. Condition Immunities: Add immunity to the grappled condition. Special Movement: Add a fly speed of 30 feet (hover) and give them the ability to teleport up to 15 feet once per turn as a bonus action. This teleport must start and end on the ground. Burning Sands: Creatures within 5 feet of a swarm take 1d4 fire damage at the start of their turn. Death Burst: When a swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a shower of razor-sharp, superheated glass shards. Each creature within 10 feet of the swarm must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Tactics: The Sand Fire Worms are aggressive and will attack the party on sight. They will use their teleport ability to quickly close the distance or flank the party. They will try to stay close to the party to maximize their Burning Sands damage. They are not particularly intelligent but will focus their attacks on vulnerable-looking targets. Objective: The party has two main options: Fight the Swarms: Defeat the Sand Fire Worms in combat. Breach the Door: Gain entry to the underground chamber through the metal door. The Door: Strength Check: The door requires a combined effort to force open. A total of three actions, adding to at least a 15 on a strength check to open the door. Multiple characters can contribute actions. Thieves' Tools: A character proficient with thieves' tools can attempt to pick the lock with a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. This will take one action. Possible Complications: Reinforcements: After a few rounds, you could have another swarm or two arrive, drawn by the commotion. Environmental Hazard: Perhaps a localised sandstorm kicks up, reducing visibility and making the terrain more difficult. Magical Interference: The magical aura from the door could interfere with spells or magical items, causing unpredictable effects (e.g., wild magic surges). Rewards: Treasure: The underground chamber could contain treasure, magical items, or clues related to the Mournland's mysteries. Story Advancement: Entering the chamber could lead to new discoveries and plot developments. Scaling the Encounter: Easier: Reduce the number of swarms, lower the DC of the door checks, or remove the Death Burst ability. Harder: Increase the number of swarms, add the complications mentioned above, or give the swarms resistance to non-magical damage. Remember to: Describe the environment vividly, emphasising the eerie and dangerous nature of the Mournland. Highlight the strange appearance and abilities of the Sand Fire Worms. Give the players agency in choosing how to approach the encounter. Be prepared to improvise based on their actions.","title":"Sample encounter"},{"location":"sample%20encounter/#encounter-title-burning-sands-shattered-glass","text":"Location: The edge of the Mournland, near [[the town of sanctuary]] Ancient ruins with a magically sealed metal door.
