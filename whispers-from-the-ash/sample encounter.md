# **Encounter Title:** Burning Sands, Shattered Glass

**Location:** The edge of the Mournland, near [[the town of sanctuary]] Ancient ruins with a magically sealed metal door.

**Environment:**

- **Ruins:** The area is strewn with crumbling stone walls, providing some [[cover]].
- **Mournland Terrain:** The ground is uneven and possibly difficult terrain: due to ash, debris, or warped earth.
- **The Door:** A large, heavy metal door, partially buried in the sand, is the focal point. It's clearly magical, radiating a faint aura (detectable with _detect magic_).
- **Visibility:** The Mournland is often described as having a hazy,  desert-like quality. Consider reducing visibility slightly, imposing disadvantage on ranged attacks beyond a certain distance or providing light obscurement.

**Enemy:** Sand Fire Worms (Reskinned [[Swarm of Insects]] - **Swarm of Poisonous Snakes** stat block from the Monster Manual)

- **Number:** 1d4 + 1 swarms.
- **Appearance:** Glowing, dismembered arms made of burning sand that writhe and slither through the air.
- **Stats:** Use the Swarm of Poisonous Snakes stat block (MM p.338), with the following modifications:
    - **Type:** Change to Monstrosity.
    - **Damage Type:** Change all damage to fire damage.
    - **Condition Immunities:** Add immunity to the grappled condition.
    - **Special Movement:** Add a fly speed of 30 feet (hover) and give them the ability to teleport up to 15 feet once per turn as a bonus action. This teleport must start and end on the ground.
    - **Burning Sands:** Creatures within 5 feet of a swarm take 1d4 fire damage at the start of their turn.
    - **Death Burst:** When a swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a shower of razor-sharp, superheated glass shards. Each creature within 10 feet of the swarm must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Tactics:**

- The Sand Fire Worms are aggressive and will attack the party on sight.
- They will use their teleport ability to quickly close the distance or flank the party.
- They will try to stay close to the party to maximize their Burning Sands damage.
- They are not particularly intelligent but will focus their attacks on vulnerable-looking targets.

**Objective:**

The party has two main options:

1. **Fight the Swarms:** Defeat the Sand Fire Worms in combat.
2. **Breach the Door:** Gain entry to the underground chamber through the metal door.

**The Door:**

- **Strength Check:** The door requires a combined effort to force open. A total of three actions, adding to at least a 15 on a strength check to open the door. Multiple characters can contribute actions.
- **Thieves' Tools:** A character proficient with thieves' tools can attempt to pick the lock with a DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. This will take one action.

**Possible Complications:**

- **Reinforcements:** After a few rounds, you could have another swarm or two arrive, drawn by the commotion.
- **Environmental Hazard:** Perhaps a localised sandstorm kicks up, reducing visibility and making the terrain more difficult.
- **Magical Interference:** The magical aura from the door could interfere with spells or magical items, causing unpredictable effects (e.g., wild magic surges).

**Rewards:**

- **Treasure:** The underground chamber could contain treasure, magical items, or clues related to the Mournland's mysteries.
- **Story Advancement:** Entering the chamber could lead to new discoveries and plot developments.

**Scaling the Encounter:**

- **Easier:** Reduce the number of swarms, lower the DC of the door checks, or remove the Death Burst ability.
- **Harder:** Increase the number of swarms, add the complications mentioned above, or give the swarms resistance to non-magical damage.

**Remember to:**

- Describe the environment vividly, emphasising the eerie and dangerous nature of the Mournland.
- Highlight the strange appearance and abilities of the Sand Fire Worms.
- Give the players agency in choosing how to approach the encounter.
- Be prepared to improvise based on their actions.
